# Data-Structure-in-BUPT
2021 is my sophomore student year in BUPT. While learning Data Structures with teacher Xu Ke, I contemplate the idea of build a repository, which consist of the homework assigned by my teacher. Including th following parts:
1. Stack
2. Queue
3. Tree
4. Hash Table
5. Sort
6. Graph
7. KMP
Those topics are very typical in learning Data Structures. I hope you can learn a lot from it and if any mistakes are found, please let me know and I'll correct them as fast as possible. 
P.S:
1. In the cpp file, my annotation are all Chinese.
2. If there are any infringement content, please contact me and I'll adjust or delete them.
3. If you are also a student learns from XuKe... with my code I believe you can finish the homework easily. But Data Structure is a very important major course so I hope you think deeply about my code instead of just copy them... Good Luck!
